"""Keep long Gemini Live conversations fast and remembered across reconnects.

Without these, Google limits a Live session to 15 minutes of audio (2 with
video, and Ember sends a camera frame every 3 s), resets every connection after
about 10 minutes, and each turn re-reads the whole growing history. So:

- context window compression: a sliding window trims the oldest context once it
  passes BAYMAX_CONTEXT_TRIGGER_TOKENS, keeping replies fast with no time limit;
- session resumption: the receive loop passes every resume handle Gemini sends
  to `remember`, and the next connection's config resumes that same
  conversation instead of starting fresh. A handle that fails to resume (no
  update arrives after using it) or is older than Google's 2 h validity is
  dropped, so a bad handle can never block reconnecting.

BAYMAX_SESSION_RESUMPTION=0 / BAYMAX_CONTEXT_COMPRESSION=0 disable each part.
Nothing new is sent anywhere: both are settings of the existing Gemini session.
