"""
Face recognition — Ember knows who is in front of it, and asks new people
who they are (with permission) before remembering them.

Models (OpenCV Zoo, downloaded once into face_models/ and hash-checked):
  YuNet  face detector    — MIT license
  SFace  face recognizer  — Apache-2.0 license, 128-d embeddings
Both run through OpenCV's built-in cv2.FaceDetectorYN / cv2.FaceRecognizerSF,
so no extra packages are needed.

Thresholds were calibrated on the LFW benchmark (2,771 images, 150 enrolled
people, 1,500 strangers, 5 samples per person): cosine >= 0.50 recognised
98.5% of probes with 0% misidentification and 0.07% of strangers wrongly
named. 0.40–0.50 is treated as "might be" — Ember asks before assuming.
Real home cameras (dim light, angles, distance) score lower than LFW, which is
why Ember keeps learning a known person's face from confident sightings.

Privacy: face embeddings (not photos) are stored only on the robot in
ember_people.json. Nobody is remembered without consent — either the family
adds photos in the app, or the person says yes when Ember asks. Strangers who
decline are remembered only in memory, for this visit, so Ember doesn't ask
again, and are never written to disk. When someone Ember knows arrives, a
head-and-shoulders crop is sent to Gemini (which already receives the camera
feed) to describe their appearance; only that text description is kept.
