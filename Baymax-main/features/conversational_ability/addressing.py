"""Play Gemini's reply only when someone was talking to Ember.

Proactive audio and the [WHEN TO SPEAK] prompt only ask Gemini to stay quiet;
it still answers noise and people talking among themselves. This gate decides
on the robot, from Gemini's own input transcription, whether a reply is played:

- the person said Ember's name (or a usual mishearing such as "Amber"; Hindi
  transcribed in Devanagari counts too: एम्बर, एंबर, अम्बर ...), or
- they spoke within BAYMAX_FOLLOW_UP_SECONDS (default 20) of Ember finishing
  speaking, so they are still in a conversation with it, or
- the reply answers one of Ember's own messages ([FALL ALERT], [REMINDER],
  [STARTUP], ...): any send_client_content(turn_complete=True) through the
  watched session, plus the reply after a tool call from an addressed turn.

Transcription can arrive after the first reply audio, so an undecided reply is
held (audio and transcript) and released if the name shows up before the turn
ends; otherwise it is dropped and logged. Gemini is not told a reply was
dropped. Noise tags such as "<noise>" are not speech.

conversation.only_when_addressed = false in device.toml (or
BAYMAX_ADDRESS_GATE=0) plays every reply again. Nothing is sent anywhere and no
device is opened: the gate only reads the existing transcription.
