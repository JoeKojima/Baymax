"""'Ember disengage' / 'Ember engage': put the conversation to sleep and wake it by voice.

While engaged nothing changes: Ember answers without needing its name. When the
user's Gemini transcript says "Ember disengage", the mic is withheld from Gemini
(it gets silence, exactly as during an audiobook) and the existing echo-cancelled
mic audio goes only to the offline Vosk listener, which wakes on a confident
"ember engage". Saying "Ember" alone, or anything else, reaches no one.

A reminder or a possible-fall check-in re-engages Ember so the person can answer.
Greetings stay quiet. The state lives in this process: reconnects keep it, a
restart starts engaged. BAYMAX_ENGAGE_WORDS=0 turns the feature off.
