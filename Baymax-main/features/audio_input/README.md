# Audio input

Optional local microphone processing for the v10 desktop Memory Palace launcher.
The existing camera/audio streams and 48 kHz rates stay in the runtime. This
module opens no devices and makes no external requests.

## Why

The old v10 sender discarded every microphone packet while playback was buffered,
so spoken interruptions and quick yes/no answers during a reply never reached
Gemini. The desktop enhancement sends those packets with a WebRTC AEC3 echo
canceller using the actual speaker callback PCM as the reference. Background
noise suppression, high-pass filtering and AGC2 volume control run before Gemini
input. Raw recordings for existing voice analysis remain unchanged.

The opt-in session configuration uses high speech-start sensitivity, zero required
speech-start padding for brief words, and 500 ms end-of-turn silence. There is no
local speech/noise gate dropping packets. This changes speech detection, not
speaker identity, transcription models or the conversation prompt.

## Inputs, outputs and dependencies

`processing.py` takes mono int16 mic samples and the already-rendered speaker PCM.
It processes whole 10 ms frames with retained leftovers and 10 ms output buffering;
it never zero-pads/discards a tail on every 1024-sample callback. Reference storage
is bounded to 250 ms and missing reference is silence. Capture/output stream
latencies provide the AEC delay hint. The capture thread alone owns native DSP;
the output callback only appends to the reference buffer.

Dependency: `pywebrtc-audio==0.2.0` (Apache-2.0), included in the isolated
`requirements-memory-pc.txt` environment. Native processing is imported only when
enabled. It adds no provider, cloud data flow, saved speaker embeddings or capture
stream. Gemini receives the processed mic audio; the existing raw recording path
is preserved. Monitor telemetry contains levels/clipping/probability only.

## Controls and fallback

`run_memory_pc.py` enables `BAYMAX_AUDIO_ENHANCEMENT=1` by default. Set it to `0`
in private `.env` for the previous raw/half-duplex behavior. Robot/direct v10
startup keeps enhancement off unless explicitly enabled. Noise suppression level
`BAYMAX_NOISE_SUPPRESSION_LEVEL` is 0–3 (default 1, moderate). Restart to apply.
AGC is limited to 18 dB adaptive gain. These settings can reduce noise, but do not
repair microphone clipping. If native processing fails, raw capture continues
with the prior playback mute rule and a visible failure state.

Monitor's Microphone card shows raw/clean RMS dBFS, raw clipping percentage, speech
probability, gain, and whether listening during replies is active. Probability
is an estimate, not proof of a particular speaker or transcription accuracy.

## Validation and limits

Eight offline checks cover continuous 1024-to-480 framing, speaker reference,
buffer bounds, disabled/failure behavior, short-speech configuration, mic routing
during playback and untouched raw recordings. Native synthetic steady-noise RMS
fell from 502 to 255 with approximately 0.5 ms processing per 21 ms input block
on this Windows PC. The SDK accepts the activity configuration. These synthetic
results do not establish real speech accuracy or echo-cancellation quality.
Actual quiet yes/no, interruptions, speaker leakage/delay and noisy-room behavior
need user testing. High speech-start sensitivity may trigger on residual noise.
