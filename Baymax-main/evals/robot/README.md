# Robot test rig (Layer 2): a test robot that tests itself against a PR

Layer 0 (`.github/workflows/offline-checks.yml`) runs `check_release.py` on every PR.
Layer 1 (`evals/live_eval.py`) plays synthetic turns straight into Ember's Gemini
session. Neither touches the robot's microphone, echo cancellation, speaker, camera,
eyes, CPU or wake words. Layer 2 does, without a person in the room:

- A dedicated **test robot** runs the PR's **real runtime** (`run_mvp.py` → `run_pc.py` →
  `realtime_gemini_N.py`) with its real devices.
- A **second USB speaker** about 2 m away plays the scripted "person" (synthetic speech)
  and noise (synthetic TV babble, music, pink noise). Ember's echo cancellation only
  removes Ember's own output, so the robot hears this like a person in the room.
- A **tablet** in front of the camera shows synthetic cards from a page the rig serves.
- The rig watches only what the runtime already writes: `.runtime-status.json`
  (`runtime_monitor.py`: states, events, transcripts, toolkit activity), the stdout log
  (`[USER]`, `[GEMINI TXT]`, `[ENGAGE]`, `[WAKE]`, `[EYES]`, `[MIC LEVEL]` ...), and CPU and
  memory of the process tree.
- It checks each scenario, writes a Markdown and JSON report, and the workflow posts
  the report on the PR.

```bash
python evals/robot/rig.py --root ../pr/Baymax-main --dry-run   # plan and gating only; opens nothing
python evals/robot/rig.py --root ../pr/Baymax-main --yes       # test robot only
python evals/robot/rig.py --calibrate --spl 60.5               # level calibration (below)
python evals/robot/rig.py --root ../pr/Baymax-main --cleanup   # stop a leftover runtime, delete recordings
```

## Design: a self-hosted runner on the test robot, composed with PR #22

**Chosen: option (a).** `.github/workflows/robot-test.yml` runs on a GitHub Actions runner
registered on the test robot (`runs-on: [self-hosted, ember-test-robot]`). It is triggered
when someone adds the `robot-test` label to a same-repository PR.

Why (a) rather than (b), driving PR #22's boot updater:

- **Per-PR and on demand.** #22's `ember-update` follows one configured PR and updates at
  boot. Switching PRs means rewriting device settings and rebooting. A labelled run
  checks out exactly the labelled commit (`head.sha`, so a later push cannot slip in),
  and the result lands back on that PR.
- **Built-in plumbing.** Actions provides queueing (`concurrency`, one robot), timeouts,
  cancellation, secrets scoped to an environment with required reviewers, and a place
  to post results. With (b) we would have to build all of that.
- **The installed release is untouched.** The PR runs from the runner's workspace.
  `~/ember-deployment/current` is never re-pointed, and no systemd unit is changed.

How it composes with #22 (Natey's files are only read, never modified):

- #22's image provisions the test robot: the OS, packages, AnyDesk, device detection, and
  an installed release with a ready `.venv`.
- `prepare_checkout.sh` reuses that `.venv` when the PR's `requirements*.txt` and
  `devops/clickables/bootstrap.py` match the installed release. This is the same
  shortcut `ember-update` takes for code-only updates. Otherwise it installs the way
  `ember-update` does, including the v10 native packages when the PR runs
  `realtime_gemini_10.py`.
- The rig's `base_env` points at the installed release's `.env`. The robot's saved
  microphone, speaker and camera choices (from Ember Setup and `ember-hardware.py`) are
  reused, and any key in that file is dropped.
- On the test robot, `ember.service` must not hold the microphone. Keep **no
  `GOOGLE_API_KEY`** in `~/ember-deployment/current/Baymax-main/.env`: `ember-run` waits
  for a key and never starts capture. Also create `~/.config/ember/no-autostart`, which
  `ember-update` honours. The rig refuses to start while any other Ember runtime is
  running (it checks every process, not just its own checkout). It never stops a
  service itself.
- Do not put the Docker nightly updater (`deploy/provision/`) on the test robot. That
  unit runs the runtime all the time.

## Scenarios (`scenarios.json`)

These are the same format as Layer 1. `heard`, `reply`, `not_reply`, `tools`,
`not_tools`, `no_tools`, `max_words` and `max_latency_s` are checked by
`live_eval.check`. Synthesis (`live_eval.synthesize`), cards (`live_eval.card`) and
config building (`live_eval.core_session`, `launcher_defaults`, `missing_requirements`)
are reused too.

| Scenario | What only the robot can show |
|---|---|
| `conversation-latency` | Two turns through the real mic and AEC; first audio within 5 s of the person's line ending (this includes Gemini's end-of-turn wait); states thinking → speaking → listening |
| `barge-in` | Talking over a long reply interrupts it (skipped while `BAYMAX_INTERRUPTION_ENABLED=0`, the MVP default) |
| `echo-own-voice` | No echo flag, no user transcript while Ember speaks, then 15 s of silence |
| `disengage-tv-engage` | PR #21: "Ember, disengage", then 2 min of synthetic TV with near-miss words ("members engaged", "embers"). Zero false wakes, nothing reaches Gemini. "Ember engage" works at 1 m and at 3 m-equivalent (−9.5 dB) |
| `reminder-reengages` | A reminder that comes due while disengaged engages Ember again and is announced |
| `look-closely-card` | PR #24: a label on the tablet, read by the real camera |
| `radio-stop` / `audiobook-stop` | "Stop" / "Ember stop" over playback from Ember's own speaker pauses it through the offline wake words (needs internet) |
| `eye-states` | `[EYES] Ready` at start, no lost sensors, and the state sequence that drives the eyes |
| `cpu-ceiling` | Mean and peak CPU (% of all cores) and resident memory of the runtime during a turn with a card |
| `restart-engaged` | A restart after "Ember disengage" comes back engaged |
| `restart-recovers` | Stop and start again; connected within 150 s, and it answers |

Step kinds:

- `say`: synthetic speech on the person speaker. Optional `distance_m` or `level_db`,
  `voice`, `timeout_s`, `observe_s`.
- `noise`: `tv`, `music` or `pink`, for `seconds`, at a `level_db`.
- `show` (card lines), `show_image`, `clear_display`.
- `wait` (seconds).
- `restart`.

Any step can take `wait_for` with `state`, `log` or `event`, plus `timeout_s` and
`after_s`.

Robot-only expectations:

- `silent`, `max_false_wakes`, `no_user_speech`
- `log` / `not_log` / `startup_log` / `event` / `not_event` (regex)
- `states` (ordered), `engaged`, `no_echo`
- `max_cpu_percent` / `max_cpu_peak_percent` / `max_rss_mb`
- `ready_within_s`

**Requirements gating.** As in Layer 1's `requires`, a scenario is skipped when the
branch lacks its feature. The checks are:

- `tools`, `any_tools` and `prompt`, from the branch's own session config. `probe.py` runs
  in the branch's interpreter and builds the config from the core that the branch's
  `run_pc.py` names.
- `files` that must exist.
- `env`: the effective value from the rig's `.env` plus the branch's launcher defaults,
  with `env_defaults` for the code default.
- `display`.

If the branch's config can't be read (for example, a v10 core the AST reader doesn't
understand), the scenarios that depend on it are skipped and the reason is reported.
The rig never guesses.

**Runs.** One runtime serves the suite. It is restarted before any scenario that follows
a failure or error, and when a scenario sets `fresh_runtime`. Conversation context
carries over between passing scenarios. Limits apply at every level: per step
(`timeout_s`), per scenario (`timeout_s`, default 600 s), for the suite
(`--max-minutes`), and in the workflow. The runtime is always stopped at the end:
first through the monitor's stop file (a clean shutdown), then SIGTERM, then SIGKILL.

## Physical setup

**Shopping list** (for one test robot):

- A second complete robot, identical to production: board, the same USB microphone,
  speaker and camera, eyes. Use #22's image.
- **Person speaker:** a small powered USB speaker that shows up as its own sound card,
  with a name that differs from Ember's speaker. Do not use another Jieli "UACDemo":
  the rig refuses any speaker that matches Ember's. Reasonably flat response; about
  $25–40.
- **Display:** a cheap Android tablet or a 7–8" screen with a stand, mains-powered, with
  sleep, notifications and auto-brightness off.
- **SPL meter:** Class 2, A-weighting, slow response; about $30–60. It is needed for
  calibration only.
- A mic stand or tripod for the speaker, a tape measure, and a powered USB hub. Wired
  ethernet is preferable.
- A room or closet that can be closed and kept empty during runs.

**Placement:**

- Put the person speaker **2 m** from the robot's microphone, at seated head height
  (about 1.1–1.2 m), pointed at the robot. Keep it at least 1 m from Ember's own speaker
  and not directly behind the robot.
- Put the tablet 40–60 cm in front of the camera so a card fills about two-thirds of the
  frame. Check the framing once on devUI's camera test.
- Keep the room as it is. Soft furnishing helps. Moving the speaker or changing its
  volume invalidates the calibration, and the next run detects that.

**Levels.** Level 0 dB is a person talking normally at 1 m: **60 dB(A) at the robot's
microphone** (`target_spl_dba`).

- `distance_m: 3` plays at −9.5 dB (inverse square law, about 50.5 dB(A)).
- The TV scenario plays at −3 dB (about 57 dB(A), TV at a normal listening level).
- Change `gain_db` or the speaker's hardware volume, never one of these per-scenario
  levels, to calibrate.

**Calibration** (once, and after moving anything):

1. Hold the SPL meter at the robot's microphone, pointed at the person speaker.
2. Run `python evals/robot/rig.py --root <installed or any checkout> --calibrate`. It
   starts the runtime (so it connects to Gemini and sends the pink noise, which is not
   speech) and plays 12 s of pink noise at level 0.
3. Enter the meter's reading. If it is more than 1 dB from 60, the rig prints the
   `gain_db` to set in `/etc/ember/robot-rig.json`. Repeat until it is within 1 dB.
4. The rig saves `calibration_file`: the gain, the SPL, and the robot's own mic level
   (median of the runtime's `[MIC LEVEL]` lines, in dBFS).

Every suite run starts with a 6 s calibration check. If the robot's mic hears the rig
more than 4 dB away from the saved level, the run stops with a **rig problem** (speaker
moved, volume changed or mic fault), so a PR is not blamed for it. Without a
calibration file the run proceeds and the report says "not calibrated".

## Runner registration (one-time, by a repository admin)

These steps add a new service for the runner. They do not change Ember's own systemd
units. The software lead approves them.

1. On the test robot:
   - `sudo mkdir -p /etc/ember && sudo touch /etc/ember/test-robot` (the marker).
   - Copy `rig.example.json` to `/etc/ember/robot-rig.json` and set
     `person_speaker.name` (see `python -m sounddevice`), or set
     `person_speaker.command` (`["pw-play", "--target", "<sink>", "{wav}"]` or
     `["aplay", "-D", "plughw:CARD=<card>", "{wav}"]`) if PipeWire hides the device
     from PortAudio.
   - Install `espeak-ng`, or set `tts_command` to a better voice such as Piper:
     `["piper", "--model", "/opt/piper/en_US-lessac-medium.onnx", "--output_file", "{wav}"]`.
     The text arrives on stdin.
   - Keep no key in the installed release's `.env`, and `touch ~/.config/ember/no-autostart`.
2. In GitHub, go to Settings → Actions → Runners → **New self-hosted runner** (Linux,
   ARM64). On the robot, as the `ember` user (it owns the PipeWire session and the
   audio devices), run:
   `./config.sh --url https://github.com/JoeKojima/Baymax --token <token> --name ember-test-1 --labels ember-test-robot --unattended`
   then `sudo ./svc.sh install ember && sudo ./svc.sh start`.
3. Under Settings → Environments, create **`ember-test-robot`**:
   - Add the secret `GEMINI_TEST_KEY`. Use a key from a separate Google Cloud project
     with a budget alert and a low quota limit, not the production key.
   - Add the software lead as a **required reviewer**, so every run waits for approval
     before the key is released.
   - Allow deployments only from branches of this repository.
4. Create the **`robot-test`** label. Labelling a PR queues a run. To run again, remove
   the label and add it again.
5. Under Settings → Actions, keep "Require approval for fork pull request workflows".
   The job's `if:` and the guard step refuse forks anyway.

**Who can trigger a run** (enforced by the workflow and `safety.py`):

- The event must be a `labeled` event with `robot-test`.
- The PR's head repository must be this repository. Forks never run.
- The PR must be open, and its author must be OWNER, MEMBER or COLLABORATOR.
- The labeller must have write, maintain or admin permission (a read-only API lookup).
- The `/etc/ember/test-robot` marker must exist.

The rig code comes from the default branch, so a PR can't weaken its own checks. Until
this layer is merged, the PR's copy is used, with a warning. The PR's code still runs
with the test key and can see the robot's devices, which is why the key is spending
capped and runs are limited to collaborators.

## Privacy and data flows

- **Sent to Google Gemini Live (by the runtime, as in production):**
  - microphone audio of the room, which should contain only the rig's synthetic speech,
    synthetic noise and Ember's own voice;
  - camera frames, which should show only the tablet's synthetic cards;
  - the MVP prompt and tools.

  The rig itself sends nothing to Gemini. **The room must be empty of people and
  private material.** The rig prints this before every run and asks for confirmation
  unless `--yes` is given (the workflow passes it; the operator keeps the room
  dedicated).
- **Real toolkit calls happen.** The runtime is real, so weather, radio and LibriVox
  providers are contacted as in production.
- **Recordings.** The v8/v9/v10 runtimes always write raw microphone audio to
  `day_utterance/seg_*.wav`. There is no switch to turn this off. `BAYMAX_AUDIO_RETENTION_DAYS<=0`
  *disables pruning* and keeps everything, so do not set it to 0.
  - The rig sets `BAYMAX_AUDIO_RETENTION_DAYS=0.01` and `BAYMAX_VOICE_ANALYSIS=0`.
  - After every run it deletes `day_utterance/seg_*.wav`, `session_*.wav`,
    `od_session_*.wav` and `transcript_*.txt` written since the run started, and
    reports the count. Any file left behind turns the report into a rig problem.
  - The workflow's always-run cleanup step repeats this if the job is cancelled.
- **The key.**
  - `GEMINI_TEST_KEY` goes into a 0600 file in a private temporary folder. The branch's
    `.env` only names that file (`GOOGLE_API_KEY_FILE`).
  - Both are removed at the end, and an existing `.env` is restored.
  - The runtime process gets no GitHub or Actions tokens.
  - The report is posted by a separate step, so the PR's code never runs alongside
    `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- **Reports.**
  - `robot-test.md` and `.json` contain the scripted lines, what the runtime transcribed
    of them, tools, states, latencies and CPU.
  - Log excerpts in the report leave out transcript lines.
  - The full runtime log (`runtime.log`) stays on the robot, in the job's temporary
    folder (deleted with the job) or `.local-review/robot/` (gitignored), and is never
    posted.
  - No audio or images are kept.

## Inputs, outputs, dependencies

- **Inputs:**
  - the branch checkout (`--root`);
  - `/etc/ember/robot-rig.json` (see `rig.example.json`), the calibration file and
    `scenarios.json`;
  - `GEMINI_TEST_KEY`;
  - for posting, `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `--pr`.
- **Outputs:** `<report-dir>/robot-test.md` and `.json`, and `runtime.log`. With
  `--post-comment` (rig) or `report.py --post` (workflow), one PR comment. Exit codes:
  0 pass, 1 fail or not confirmed, 2 refused.
- **Dependencies:**
  - the branch's own `.venv` (numpy, opencv, sounddevice, python-dotenv, google-genai
    for the probe);
  - `espeak-ng` or a `tts_command`;
  - `ps`, and psutil (optional: `/proc` is used otherwise).
  - `safety.py` and `report.py` use only the standard library, so the workflow runs
    them with the system `python3`.
- **Enabling and disabling:**
  - Nothing in the runtime imports the rig.
  - To enable, register the runner and create the label and environment.
  - To disable, take the runner offline, remove the label, or delete
    `/etc/ember/test-robot`; the rig then refuses.

## Tests

`tests/test_robot_rig.py` (core section, offline) uses fakes from `fakes.py`:

- a clock that advances on sleep;
- a speaker that records what it plays;
- a display;
- a CPU sampler;
- a scripted `FakeRobot` that writes `.runtime-status.json` and a log in the runtime's
  formats.

Covered:

- **Scenario file:** validation, and coverage of the hardware checks.
- **Gating:** including a real probe of this branch, where `barge-in` is skipped
  because the MVP turns interruptions off.
- **Ideal robot:** every scenario in `scenarios.json` passes against one.
- **Failure cases:**
  - a false wake during TV, and audio reaching Gemini while disengaged;
  - echo, slow first audio, and a reminder that never re-engages;
  - a runtime crash (error, then a fresh runtime for the next scenario);
  - a runtime that never connects, and the CPU or memory ceiling;
  - a sticky disengage after restart, and the suite time limit.
- **Calibration:** pass, drift detection, and saving only when on target.
- **Observer:** event deduplication, ignoring the previous session, partial log lines,
  engagement reset on restart.
- **Safety:**
  - the marker, the trigger guard (forks, labels, permissions) and the key and `.env`
    lifecycle;
  - deletion of only this run's recordings;
  - token stripping from the runtime environment.
- **Report rendering and posting:** only with the flag.
- **`rig.main` end to end** with fake hardware: refusal without the marker or
  confirmation, dry run, missing key, cleanup.
- **Real hardware classes with stand-ins:**
  - the speaker chosen by name, which refuses Ember's own;
  - the HTTP display on localhost;
  - finding other runtimes;
  - stopping a dummy runtime through the stop file, and with SIGTERM;
  - the CPU sampler.

No microphone, camera or speaker is opened, and nothing contacts Gemini or GitHub.

## What still needs a human

- **Setup and approval:**
  - buying and placing the hardware, calibrating, registering the runner;
  - approving each run (environment reviewer);
  - tuning the CPU and memory ceilings from the first baseline run (the current numbers
    are placeholders).
- **Things the rig cannot see:**
  - **What the eyes look like.** The telemetry records eye *expressions* (on some
    branches) but not the displayed mode, so `eye-states` checks startup, sensors and
    the driving states only. Look at the eyes, or add a second camera later.
  - **How Ember sounds** (volume, distortion) to a listener, and fall detection.
- **Real voices.** Synthetic speech differs from people. Layer 1 found that Gemini
  transcribed synthetic "Ember, disengage." as ".". A robotic espeak voice through a
  speaker may fail the same way, so use a natural `tts_command` voice. Check any failure
  of a transcript-matched command with a real voice before blaming the PR.
- **Judging failures.** A run is evidence for the reviewer. Gemini is
  non-deterministic, so one pass or fail needs judgement. Re-run if in doubt.
- **First live use.** None of the hardware path has run on a robot yet. The workflow,
  `prepare_checkout.sh`, sounddevice and command playback, the HTTP display on a tablet,
  `[MIC LEVEL]` calibration, the regexes for real `[WAKE]`, `[ENGAGE]`, radio and
  audiobook output, and stopping a real `run_mvp.py` all need a supervised first run.
